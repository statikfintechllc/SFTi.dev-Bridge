# SFTi DevBridge

**Live iOS PWA ↔ AI Agent Diagnostic Runtime**

A self-contained diagnostic plugin that gives an AI agent real-time observability into a PWA running on an iPhone over LAN. Console intercept, network tracing, storage inspection, screenshot capture, and remote JS evaluation — all through a card-based task queue.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Activate the self-contained venv
source DevBridge/.venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies (first time only)
pip install -r DevBridge/ai.server/requirements.txt

# Start the bridge server (logs write to DevBridge/server.log automatically)
python3 DevBridge/ai.server/server.py
# → 📡 LAN URL: http://192.168.x.x:8765

# Open on iPhone: visit the LAN URL in Safari
# Tap Share → Add to Home Screen → Open from Home Screen
```

## Integrating DevBridge into a Host PWA

Add two things to the host application:

### 1 — Load the bridge script

```html
<!-- Add before </body> in your host app's HTML -->
<script src="http://<LAN_IP>:8765/bridge.js"></script>
```

The bridge self-initializes, detects the server URL, and begins telemetry capture and card polling with no further configuration.

### 2 — Add a DevBridge entry in the navigation / Advanced Settings

In the app's settings menu or navigation sidebar, add an entry that opens the DevBridge dashboard in a new window or navigates to it:

```html
<!-- Option A: open in browser (fullscreen diagnostic view) -->
<a href="http://<LAN_IP>:8765/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
  DevBridge Diagnostics
</a>

<!-- Option B: embedded iframe inside an "Advanced Settings" panel -->
<iframe
  id="devbridge-frame"
  src="http://<LAN_IP>:8765/"
  style="width:100%;height:100%;border:none;"
  allow="storage-access"
></iframe>
```

The recommended pattern for future builds is **Option A** — open the DevBridge dashboard at `/` as a separate fullscreen view triggered from an "Advanced Settings" row. This keeps the diagnostic surface completely isolated from the host app's UI and lets the agent observe both the host PWA (via `bridge.js` telemetry) and the DevBridge dashboard simultaneously.

When DevBridge is not needed, remove the `<script>` tag. Zero runtime overhead when disabled.
